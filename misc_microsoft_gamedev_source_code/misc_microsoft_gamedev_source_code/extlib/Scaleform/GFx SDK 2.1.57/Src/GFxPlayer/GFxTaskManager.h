// GFxTask describes a task that can be queued up for potential execution
// on a different thread. Users can create new tasks by overriding this
// class and impementing its Execute virtual function.
// Tasks are added for execution by a call to FxTaskManager::AddTask, at which
// point they become pending execution. Task objects will be AddRefed
// by the task manager and then by the container thread; once the task
// has completed it will be released.
