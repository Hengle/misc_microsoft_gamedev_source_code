/// This is an example collision filter. It is open source and can be modified to produce a 
/// filter which exactly matches your requirements.  However, the implementation of the collision
/// filter can be a significant factor in performance of your physics. This filter is designed to
/// allow custom filtering between bones in different ragdolls or other constrained systems in your world,
/// by doing simple operations on two 32 bit numbers.  The collision detection pipeline is setup to produce
/// these 32 bit numbers, called collision filter infos.  Using this filter (or one very like it) for all
/// your filtering will give optimal cache performance, and we strongly recommend using this if possible.
///
/// It inherits from hkpCollisionFilter, and so implements each of the 4 hkpCollisionFilter::isCollisionEnabled
/// methods. For each method, it extracts two 32 bit values from the inputs (one representing each object to be 
/// tested), and passes these values to a common filtering mechanism.
///
/// We split the 32 bit value into a layer (5 bits), a system group (16 bits), a subsystem id (5 bits),
/// and the id of another subsystem that we do not want to collide with (5 bits).  The filter allows the user
/// to specify whether collisions are enabled or disabled between every pair of layers.
///
/// The exact logic of the filter is as follows:
///
/// If two entities share the same system group (except group 0) then:
///		they collide if A.subSystemId != B.subSystemDontCollideWith and B.subSystemId != A.subSystemDontCollideWith.
/// Otherwise:
///		they collide if collisions between their layers are enabled (based on a 32*32 bitfield).
///
/// Some things to keep in mind:
///
///	    - Collisions between layer 0 and any other layer should not be disabled (by default all layers 
///       collide with all other layers, including themselves).  This is a policy decision for shape collection filtering. 
///		  All shape collections are required to implement hkpShapeCollection::getCollisionFilterInfo for each child shape. 
///		  By default this returns 0 (i.e. if no special child shape filter information is set).  
///		  So if you disable layer 0 in the group filter and use this filter as a shape collection filter,
///		  it will disable collisions with children of all default shape collections.
///		- System group 0 is special in that if two objects of system group 0 are under consideration, their subystem id 
///       will not be considered.  Instead, only the layer information will be used.
///
/// <br>
/// The class provides helper methods for getting and setting these values. <br>
/// <br>
///
///	Examples:
///     -   Keyframed objects should not collide with static geometry. Therefore 
///	        we can put all static geometry into one layer and all the keyframed object into
///         another layer. Then we disable the collision between these layers.
///		-   All elements of a ragdoll should collide with each other, except those that are connected by 
///         a constraint. In this case we assign all bodies of the ragdoll to the same system group. Also we assign
///			a unique subSystemId for each body in the ragdoll. Then we set subSystemDontCollideWith
///			to the id of the parent rigidbody (assuming you see the ragdoll as a hierarchy of bodies
///         and constraints, see the hkaRagdollUtils for details)
/// <br>
/// Note:<br>
///     If two shape collections A and B collide, the following will happen
///        - the collidable of A and B will be checked
///        - then, one of the collections will be expanded, say in our case A will be replaced by 
///          its children A# = { A0, A1, ... An }
///        - Each collisionInfo of child A# (see hkpShapeCollection::getCollisionFilterInfo()) will
///          be tested against hkpCollidable::getCollisionFilterInfo() of B
///        - then for each A# B will be expanded into its children B# = {B0, B1, ...Bn}
///        - Each collisionInfo of child A# (see hkpShapeCollection::getCollisionFilterInfo()) will be tested
///          against collisionInfo of child B# 
///    Interestingly, B was never tested against A#. That means if you have a complex shape collection hierarchy,
///          you think about your filters very carefully.
