	/// An hkpConvexTranslateShape contains an hkpShape and an additional translation for that shape. 
	///	This is useful, for instance, if you
	/// want to position child shapes correctly when constructing a compound shape.
	/// The advantage of using hkpConvexTranslateShape over hkpTransformShape is that
	/// it does not require additional agents to be created, as the hkpConvexTranslateShape is
	/// a convex shape and directly works with GSK.
	/// However, if you use the hkpConvexTranslateShape wrapping an hkpBoxShape, no hkpBoxBoxAgent will be
	/// created, but the hkpGskfAgent.
	///
	/// On PS3 this shape's collision detection will only be allowed to move onto an SPU if
	/// a) all its children are supported on SPU
	/// b) its total size including all its children will fit into one of the SPU's shape buffers
	/// If this is the case a call to getChildShape() on the SPU will dma in the child shape from
	/// main memory (and thus cause a code execution stall). To improve this we have added
	/// support for the situation where the child shape follows this hkpConvexTranslateShape consecutively in memory.
	/// In such a case both the hkpConvexTranslateShape and its child shape are brought in in one
	/// single dma operation. Note that this properly takes care of cascades as well, i.e. several
	/// hkConvexTranslateShapes in a row are all brought in in one go.
	/// hkpConvexTransformShape supports the same mechanism and thus works as part of such a cascade as well.
