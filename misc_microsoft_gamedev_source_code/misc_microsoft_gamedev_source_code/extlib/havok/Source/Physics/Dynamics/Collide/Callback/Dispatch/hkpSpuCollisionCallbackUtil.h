	/// This is an utility class, which helps to export callback information from the spu to the ppu. This is just an example how to do this.
	/// Please copy the files for ppu and spu and create your own version. 
	/// For future Havok physics versions this class is subject to change.
	///
	/// The SPU is severely memory-limited, so to be able to properly handle collision events (without any restrictions) as soon as the collision
	/// detection is running on the SPU we need to forward those events to the PPU. This utility handles the forwarding of the events. Simply
	/// create an instance of this utility using the static createSpuCollisionCallbackUtil() function. Pass in the total amount of memory you want
	/// the utility to have. Note that this includes the buffer for the events, so don't make it too small. You then have to attach this utility
	/// to each entity you want the events forwarded for. During collision detection this utility will now collect all 3 types of collision events
	/// (added, processed and removed), repack them, add them to the utility's event queue and write this event data back to the PPU. On the PPU
	/// you now only have to call fireCallbacks() with a pointer to your user-implemented callback functions. This will fire the appropriate
	/// callback function for each collision event and pass in the corresponding event data. Make sure to reset the event queue on your last call
	/// to fireCallbacks() (in case you should call it several times) or otherwise the queue will fill up pretty fast, preventing any further events
	/// to be forwarded from SPU to PPU.
