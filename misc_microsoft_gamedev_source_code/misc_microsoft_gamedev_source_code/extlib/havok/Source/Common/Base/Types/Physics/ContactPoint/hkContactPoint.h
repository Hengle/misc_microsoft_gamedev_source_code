/// m_normal always points such that moving object A in the direction of the normal 'separates'
/// the bodies. In other words, moving object A by -distance units in the direction of the normal
/// will bring the bodies into exact (surface) contact. The direction of the normal does not change
/// if the bodies become penetrating, but the distance will become negative. Thus the normal always points
/// "into" A, and "out of" B.
///
/// m_position is the contact point. It may be anywhere between the two "closest" points, depending on
/// the agent which created it, but usually it's on object B surface. In the penetrating case the "closest points"
/// is the pair which determines the direction of minimum separation.
///
/// The distance (returned by getDistance()) is the distance between "closest points" on A and B.
/// If this distance is negative, the bodies are penetrating.
///
/// NOTE: To be totally precise, moving object A in the positive direction of the normal 'separates' the 
/// "closest points", but is not (in the case of concave or compound bodies) guaranteed to separate
/// the bodies themselves. 
///
/// NOTE: When this structure is used in the hkpCdPointCollector callback from the hkpCollisionAgent::linearCast function,
/// the "distance" value is actually the parameter between 0 and 1 along the linear cast that the hit occurred
