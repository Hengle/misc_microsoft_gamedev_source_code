/// A double-buffered dma writer class.
///
/// This writer class holds two separate buffers, each of them consisting of a base part and an overflow part.
/// Requesting a buffer using requestBuffer() returns a valid pointer to local spu memory ready for
/// writing. The user has to assert that he is not writing more data than can actually be stored inside
/// a single one of the two buffers (i.e. not more than base + overflow size). When writing is officially
/// finished by the user with finishWrite() the writer will itself dma-out the contents of the current
/// buffer if it has already completely filled its base part and switch to the second buffer for
/// future writing. As long as the base part of the currenty active buffer is not filled completely, no
/// dma writing will take place.
