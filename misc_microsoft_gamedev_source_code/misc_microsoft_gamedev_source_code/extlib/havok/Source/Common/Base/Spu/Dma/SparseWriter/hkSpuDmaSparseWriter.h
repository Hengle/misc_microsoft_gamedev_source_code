	/// A double-buffered dma writer class.
	/// <ag.todo.aa> fix reference manual comments
	/// This writer class holds two separate buffers, each of them consisting of a base part and an overflow part.
	/// Requesting a buffer using requestBuffer() returns a valid pointer to local spu memory ready for
	/// writing. The user has to assert that he is not writing more data than can actually be stored inside
	/// a single one of the two buffers (i.e. not more than base + overflow size). When writing is officially
	/// finished by the user with finishWrite() the writer will itself dma-out the contents of the current
	/// buffer if it has already completely filled its base part and switch to the second buffer for
	/// future writing. As long as the base part of the currenty active buffer is not filled completely, no
	/// dma writing will take place.
