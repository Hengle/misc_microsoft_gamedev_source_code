/// This is the interface to a statistics collector for Havok objects. Currently it only
/// collects memory usage statistics but could be extended in future to collect other
/// useful stats. Timing stats are collected separately through the hkMonitorStream.
///
/// All hkReferencedObject in Havok (most user level objects) have the following virtual call:
///
///    virtual void calcStatistics( hkStatisticsCollector* collector ) const { }
///
/// That call fills out the current memory usage of the object's data, excluding what is
/// counted in the m_memSizeAndFlags member of the hkReferencedObject itself. That is
/// to say that the storage for all its members will be automatically in the object size
/// already, but hkArrays for instance have external data storage which the object
/// adds and also lets the collector know of any pointed to, owned, children so it can recurse.
/// Normally the statistics collectors record the memory used the the object
/// (m_memSizeAndFLags + all used (<= allocated, eg: hkArray:getSize())) and also the total
/// allocated (m_memSizeAndFLags + all allocated (eg: hkArray::getCapacity()) ) so that
